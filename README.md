### Hi there 👋

###🔧 Tech Entrepreneur & Python Enthusiast 🔍
For the past 10 years, I've been at the helm of a successful phone and computer service business, wearing multiple hats as the owner-manager, technician, and sales consultant. Over the last 1.5 years, I've passionately immersed myself in the world of Python, gaining proficiency in PostgreSQL, GitHub, Django ORM, and object-oriented programming (OOP).

###🌐 Technical Proficiency:
Python (Fluent)
PostgreSQL

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
🛠️ Projects:
I've developed two notable projects—a Discord Bot showcasing my Python skills and an internal management software for our store, crafted with Flask and powered by PostgreSQL. This software optimizes client management for device repairs, highlighting my commitment to leveraging technology for practical problem-solving.

###📚 Continuous Learning:
Enthusiastic about Python, I'm dedicated to ongoing learning, accumulating new knowledge every day. Currently, I'm gearing up for courses on Containers and Cloud, delving into Linux Shell, Docker, and Cloud technologies.
